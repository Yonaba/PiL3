This repository contains the source code for exercices and various notes I wrote while reading the book [Programming in Lua, Third Edition](http://store.feistyduck.com/products/programming-in-lua) (by *Roberto Ierusalimschy*), which is, by excellence, __the__ book to learn [Lua](http://www.lua.org).

You can buy the paper book on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/859037985X/lua-docs-20), or get the [ebook](http://store.feistyduck.com/products/programming-in-lua).

##Lua : 5.2
All of the source code written here is targetted at [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.2), but is likely to work with [Lua 5.1](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1)/[5.0](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.0). Actually, this introspection in the language have been motivated by the need to fully understand the changes in *Lua 5.2*.<br>
My source code editor of choice is [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).<br>
You can download [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/download.html), get the [latest binaries](http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBinaries) for your platform or try the [live demo](http://www.lua.org/demo.html).<br>
The [reference manual for Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html) is available online (in plain HTML) for your perusal.

##Final notes
I will be updating the contents of this repository while reading the book, so basically on my spare times.
Meanwhile, all comments, critics will be much appreciated. You can open a [ticket](https://github.com/Yonaba/PiL3/issues) or better, [pull  a request](https://github.com/Yonaba/PiL3/pulls).
